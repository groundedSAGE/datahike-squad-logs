- # Welcome to Datahike Squad Logs! 
    - This is a space for tracking the progress of implementing the Datahike database in the open.
    - It is a fusion of Product/Project Management, working journals of Core Contributors, and an Education platform. 
        - To paraphrase [[Brandon Toner]] from [[Roam Collective]]. It is about __accumulating shared knowledge__ and __accomplishing shared objectives __through the driving force of communication.
        - "Conversation is RICH with value. Questions are asked, resources are shared, opportunities are identified, and ideas are born. " ~ [[Brandon Toner]] 
    - Unfortunately, database knowledge is far too specialized despite the fact that the entire world depends on databases. You can [teach yourself](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) virtually everything in Computer Science. But you will find that learning about Databases is the most difficult.
    - Squad Log objectives:
        - To build a database that follows the [[Product Vision]].
        - To provide a hub for all meta-conversation surrounding the implementation of the database.
        - To provide a hub for connecting all external sources and artifacts related to [[Datahike]] and it's implementation. 
        - To help others see that anyone can learn about the database internals and participate in its development.
        - To expand the [Bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) related to [[Datahike]] such that the bus is no longer a factor.  By ensuring a significant amount of people are knowledgeable about Datahike internals and that enough resources are available such that anyone can teach themselves.
