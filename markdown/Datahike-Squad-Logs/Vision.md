- Description::
    - We are building a graph database designed to allow the global persistence, composition, and querying of data. Since data is everywhere; we want this database to fit as many use cases as possible. Thus the desire is for it to be general purpose enough for usage in: computer resource management, logistics, social networks, sensor data, financial transactions, and any other sources of data. 
        - [[Datahike]] follows the design of [[Datomic]]. Which has a wide array of [success stories](https://clojure.org/community/success_stories) as well as a long [list of companies](https://clojure.org/community/companies) using it. Datomic is the primary database used at and [now](https://cognitect.com/blog/2020/07/23/Cognitect-Joins-Nubank) owned by [[Nubank]] - the largest fintech company in Latin America.
    - Some may call Datahike a "Worldly Database". As it strives to connect all information and knowledge with a unified way to write and query data. Regardless of the domain.
