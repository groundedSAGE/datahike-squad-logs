    - Date Range:: [[February 22nd, 2021]] until [[March 15th, 2021]]
    - Description:: We want development of Datahike to be as transparent as possible. Despite most of open source using things such as Github and a chat service like Discord. It's difficult to keep track of conversation, decisions, and work done across all of these different tools and all repositories. The flexibility for extension is also limited.
