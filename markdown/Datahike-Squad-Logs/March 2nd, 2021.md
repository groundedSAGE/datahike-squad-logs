    - #Scratchpad
        - created a way to detect when a story is blocked. Still iterating on this idea. I messaged [[Brandon Toner]] to see how they do it in [[Roam-Collective]] and it's very similar thinking to what I thought [*](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Roam-Collective/page/5Zx9LGHrL). It might be possible to automate some of this using [[roam/render]] and [[roam/datalog]] queries but for now it's best to do it as a manual process
        - Got the tests passing for [entity-test](((v0Vclr36k))). 
            - `ILookup` of `Entity` inside [[NS/datahike/impl/datahike.impl.entity]] now checks if it has been touched in order to keep synchronous semantics of lookups
                - Touching the Entity is required by the user which allows maximum flexibility for the interface. 
                    - If it has been touched that means the first level of data is in the cache and can get retrieved **synchronously**. Throwing an error if otherwise. 
                    - If it is touched but you are performing a __reverse reference lookup__ this throws an error. For a __reverse reference lookup__ you need to call the `lookup-entity` function directly which returns a channel and as a result is **asynchronous**. Pre-fetching arbitrarily related entities for the cache is not possible within the scope of the current work. This is an [[optimisation]] which could come with more design thinking after [[Epics/ClojureScript Support]] is finished.
            - [[.Falsified]] 
                - `IFn` of `Entity` inside [[NS/datahike/impl/datahike.impl.entity]] uses `-lookup` instead of `lookup-entity`
                    - #Q Is it better to have `IFn` **async** by default since it uses `lookup-entity` then throw an error when the entity has already been touched or do we allow the entity to already be touched and handle the **async** lookups?
                        - I think it is better to keep this using `lookup-entity` and be **async** since it is a lower level API. The user would then need to keep around a copy of the untouched entity to use this. Which would also be required when they want to do a __reverse reference lookup__ anyways.
            - updated tests in [[NS/datahike.test.entity-test]] to reflect the changes to the API [*](((8fyQ--ie_)))
