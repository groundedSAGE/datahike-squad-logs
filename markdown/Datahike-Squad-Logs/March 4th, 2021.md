    - #Scratchpad 
        - monkey patched `throw-if-exception` of [[NS/hitchhiker.tree.utils.cljs.async]] to not nest the errors through the stack of [[core.async]] channels. This will need to be backported and further considered in [[library/hitchhiker-tree]].
            - {{[[TODO]]}} [[story/Improve [[core.async]] Error Handling]]
        - updated [[NS/datahike.test.filter-test]] based on changes made to the lookups [*](((8fyQ--ie_)))
        - work on ""{{[[DONE]]}} datahike.test.core-test""
            - provided convenience functions `count<` and `seq<` in [[NS/datahike.db]]
            - {{[[TODO]]}} [[story/Implement Reverse Iterator in [[library/hitchhiker-tree]]]]
            - {{[[TODO]]}} [[story/Keep active count of database for when people call count]]
                - This would make `count<` utility redundant [*](((WOtSPGFXO)))
            - was looking at the [[NS/datahike.index]] during this work
                - {{[[TODO]]}} [[story/Support PresistentSortedSet]]
                    - This was commented out during initial porting work and will remain this way for now. The reason is that it does not compile in ClojureScript currently
                    - Using [[library/hitchhiker-tree]] in memory has a performance overhead so supporting this will provide a similar experience for those used to [[Datascript]]
