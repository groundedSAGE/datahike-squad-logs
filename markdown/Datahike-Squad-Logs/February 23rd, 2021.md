        - "#Q Is it meaningful having the timestamped daily log on the individual daily notes or does it add too much pressure to people?"
            - I quite like having it. But I can see how it would maybe make people feel uncomfortable to contribute to the graph instead of just allowing them to add in a log of what they have worked on without time stamping it. I would definitely timestamp the [[Squad Logs]] since that is more of a group effort and shared responsibility for the time allocated towards the work.

                - https://twitter.com/austinbirch/status/1330613743886225411
            - Added "Epic" template
            - Added details for [[Epics/Set up a Unified Public Place for all Datahike Development]] 
            - Added details for [[Epics/ClojureScript Support]]
            - Added details for [[Epics/Distributed Connection Management]]

            - writing into the "#Scratchpad" about my thoughts on the burn down charts and story points 
        - 22:59
            - Added template for Community Notes
                - Also made some adjustments to how the Epic and Sprint pages are managed to get them to show up in the Community Notes queries for what is active. I will need to do some more tweaking to this because the automatically generated query probably needs to use Roam42 templates. I also need to dig further on the "[[(i) RoamAgile]]" etc to figure out how I can make changes with it.
                    - {{[[TODO]]}} Learn how we can adapt this graph ourselves with custom written code
    - #Scratchpad
        - Was thinking about my question from last week to [[Chris Smothers]] - ""#Q I wonder what the value is in the Burn Chart?""
            - I was reading that the story points make it possible to review the average amount of story points a team is able to get done each sprint. Then when you have this it makes it possible to track more easily if there is too many stories being added to a sprint based on the story point count. 
    - #Questions
        - #Q Is it meaningful having the timestamped daily log on the individual daily notes or does it add too much pressure to people?
            - I quite like having it. But I can see how it would maybe make people feel uncomfortable to contribute to the graph instead of just allowing them to add in a log of what they have worked on without time stamping it. I would definitely timestamp the [[Squad Logs]] since that is more of a group effort and shared responsibility for the time allocated towards the work. 
    - #[[Conversation]]
        - What do you think about the [question](((DXfFS6E4T))) [[@[[Chris Smothers]]]]? I also added my thoughts below the question.

            - I worked on this but it needs more work and I need to sync up with the rest of the people involved with the [[Roadmap]]. Also the reason that I did not get to [updating the product roadmap](((56fAhDPA1)))
        - {{[[DONE]]}} Add onboarding for new members

    - #Reflection
        - Made a bunch of improvements to the graph today and also added more onboarding material. I'm looking forward to feedback from others with how well this onboarding material works for them. I'm sure there is a bunch of improvements that can be made there.
