        - It would be nice to have a library like [[Criterium]] in [[Clojurescript]] but this is only for the JVM.
            - There is some resources on how to get going with benchmarking for JS environments but it's tough.
                - Resources:: 
                    - [Good CLJS library for benchmarking?](https://clojureverse.org/t/good-cljs-library-for-benchmarking/1242) #Clojureverse
                    - [ClojureScript Performance Measurement](https://blog.fikesfarm.com/posts/2017-11-18-clojurescript-performance-measurement.html) #[[Mike Fikes]]
        - I could do some very simple benchmarks. But while I am on this track it's more meaningful to go the entire way and figure out how to set up benchmarking across JavaScript VM's.
            - So I will follow the directions from "[ClojureScript Performance Measurement](https://blog.fikesfarm.com/posts/2017-11-18-clojurescript-performance-measurement.html) #[[Mike Fikes]]". This clearly has a cascade of tasks to follow and resources to read up on.

                - A 64-bit Intel Mac running 10.15.4+. (Building on Arm Macs is¬†[not yet supported](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master/docs/mac_arm64.md).)
                - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)¬†12.2+. This version of Xcode comes with ...
                - The macOS 11.0 SDK. Run
                - ```shell
$ ls `xcode-select -p`Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs```
                - to check whether you have it. Building with a newer SDK usually works too (please fix it if it doesn't), but the releases¬†[currently use Xcode 12.2](https://source.chromium.org/search?q=MAC_BINARIES_LABEL&ss=chromium)¬†and the macOS 11.0 SDK.
            - My system is:
                - Hardware
                    - Mac mini (2018)
                    - Intel Core i7
                - Software
                    - Current OS:
                        - macOS Big Sur
                        - Version 11.2.1
                    - Xcode
                        - Version 12.5 beta 3
            - This [command](((oJthUjErb))) to check for Xcode on the machine does not work for me 
                - However this does `xcode-select -p`
                    - Returns: `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`
