        - It would be nice to have a library like [[Criterium]] in [[Clojurescript]] but this is only for the JVM.
            - There is some resources on how to get going with benchmarking for JS environments but it's tough.
                - Resources::

        - I could do some very simple benchmarks. But while I am on this track it's more meaningful to go the entire way and figure out how to set up benchmarking across JavaScript VM's.
            - So I will follow the directions from "[ClojureScript Performance Measurement](https://blog.fikesfarm.com/posts/2017-11-18-clojurescript-performance-measurement.html) #[[Mike Fikes]]". This clearly has a cascade of tasks to follow and resources to read up on.
