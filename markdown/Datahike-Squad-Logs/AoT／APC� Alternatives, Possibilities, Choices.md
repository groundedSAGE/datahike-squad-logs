    - APC is pronounced with each letter separate: 'A', 'P', 'C'. It is another attention-directing algorithm. It facilitates __parallel__ thinking as opposed to __forward__ thinking. There are many different aspects APC can be applied to:
    
        - **Perception**: When the same thing can be looked at in
    different ways.
        - **Action**: Different courses of action can be taken in a
    situation.
        - **Solutions:** Alternative solutions to a problem.
        - **Approaches**: Different ways of tackling the problem in order
    to find a solution.
        - **Explanations**: Alternative hypotheses / explanations of how
    something happened.
        - **Design**: Alternative designs that all fulfill the the purpose
    of the design.
    - 
  Sometimes we are forced to consider alternatives, because we get stuck with one approach. At other we look for alternatives to find a better one. In my experience the first solution that comes to mind is just that, the first solution. It is hard not to fall in love with it, but often further thinking yields better alternatives. To make the best use of the algorithm, you must be very clear about the purpose of looking for an alternative. e.g.:Â __"I want an alternative way of getting from the airport to the hotel."__
    - ### Example
        - **Situation:** I almost religiously avoid cash. I once arrived at London Heathrow at 1 am in the morning. I was booked at an "airport hotel" which was near the airport, but not exactly walking distance. I needed to make my way there. I had no cash only a credit card.
        - **Alternatives, Possibilities, Choices:**
            - Get a cab and pay with my card (I couldn't find one that would accept my card - even if I promised a generous tip)
            - Walk to the hotel (no walkway, long distance)
            - Get cash from an ATM (getting cash with a credit card is an option, but it is expensive)
            - Call the hotel to send a car (they did not operate cars at 1 am)
            - Call the hotel and agree a payout from my room account, and pay the driver in cash (the actual solution)
