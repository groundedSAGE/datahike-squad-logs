    - Explore the sample [RoamAgile](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/RoamAgile/page/cXU68xJim) Roam Graph. That is the graph that was used to develop this template. Navigating [RoamAgile](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/RoamAgile/page/cXU68xJim) should help you better understand the intended use of this template.
- ## What is [[(i) RoamAgile]]?
    - [[(i) RoamAgile]] is designed for managing an Agile Scrum Product Development process completely in Roam. This includes the design of the product, tracking of development work, and facilitation of the Scrum Ceremonies.
    - ### Product vision for RoamAgile
        - I created [[(i) RoamAgile]] with the following vision in mind.
        - Create a Roam template and a how-to guide for Agile Product Development in Roam, assuming as a base case scenario that Roam is the only task and user story management tool used by the team. Develop a fully self-sustained solution built 100% around Roam's capabilities.
        - Storytelling and flexibility are at the heart of Agile Product Development. This is in contrast to traditional Waterfall Project Management where requirements specification and delivery control are at the center. 
            - Leverage Roam's strengths for creating stories and connections. In Agile Product Development [[User Story]]s, [[Personas]], solution Dilemmas, [[Customer Feedback]], etc. are intertwined with the [[Backlog]], Sprint Plans, and the [[Product Roadmap]].
            - Integrate Algorithms of Thought models such as #CAF #ADI #PMI #CnS #APC #OPV #choice #TOSCA into the product development workflow.
        - Use Roam's query and task management features to develop a practical workflow for the development team using Roam.
        - Integrate all key elements of an Agile Product Development process, assuming an Agile Scrum approach:
            - Support key ceremonies:
                - Backlog Grooming
                - Sprint Planning
                - Daily Standups
                - Sprint Demo
                - Sprint Retrospective and maintaining an evergreen [[(i) Team Ways of Working]] page
            - Develop templates for key artifacts including
                - Product Vision
                - Product Roadmap
                - Map of Personas
                - Customer Journey Map
                - Feature and Story Mapping
            - Support key supplementary workflows
                - Managing [[Customer Feedback]]
                - Resolving Design and Feature Dilemmas
    - ### Product Design
        - Articulate the [[Product Vision]] on a dedicated page pinned to the sidebar
        - "Develop your [[Personas]]"
            - You may try De Bono's [[AoT/OPV: Other People's Views]] to identify stakholders. `jjOPV`
            - Create a page for each [[Persona]] under the **persona/** namespace and using the `;;persona` template
        - Develop #[[User Journey]]s 
            - Use [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/user-journey) `{{mermaid}}` to visulize the journey.
        - Write [[User Story]]s
            - Use [Algorithms of Thoughs]([[roamAgile/AoT]]) built into [[(i) RoamAgile]]
            - Link to other stories, to [[Customer Feedback]], etc. Go wild with Roam's power in networked thought
        - Plan the [[Product Roadmap]]
        - "Capture [[Customer Feedback]]"
            - Use {{Add Customer Feedback}} on [[Customer Feedback]] to add feedback to your database.
                - The SmartButton will ask for the feedback, past it from the clipboard.
                - It will then run Sentiment Analysis, ask for feedback type and offer the opportunity to assign an owner. Owners are offered from the [[roamAgile/team]] page.
                - Feedback will be created as a `{{[[TODO]]}}` item. This enables you to filter feedbacks on the page, that have been fully processed.
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamAgile%2FT3pHxJ2vxd.png?alt=media&token=1f20a355-08a7-42c4-84de-490d53944549)

                - Nest actions, or new user stories in the **story/** namespace under the feedback to track your actions in context.
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamAgile%2Fml91BxoFVA.png?alt=media&token=a24a04ac-833c-4a40-9c2d-cc38f8e88c69)
    - ### Tracking Development Work
        - Use the Product [[Backlog]] to rank and organize user stories
            - {{Find stories missing from the Backlog}} To find stories in the graph that are not referenced on the backlog. This caters for the use-case that while writing other user stories, working on personas, processing [[Customer Feedback]], etc. you can simply create new user stories in context by creating a page link to a page in the **story/** namespace. The sync button helps you tie these loose ends, by pulling all these story embryos into your backlog.
                - "üìù**Note:** the button in the how-to is a dummy button"
        - "Use `;;User Story` to populate the story page with a template"
        - "Use `;;sprint` to populate the sprint page with a template"
        - Burn down chart on [[Sprint]] page helps you track team velocity.
        - Kanban board to track progress with stories committed for the [[Sprint]]
    - ### Scrum Ceremonies
        - "Daily standup (aka. Daily Scrum) meeting"
            - "üìù**Note:** The kanban board on the Daily Standup page is not automatically synchronized with the active sprint. The kanban board for each person on the Daily Notes page is only intended as a snapshot in time to reflect status of development work."
        - Sprint Planning
            - "Use `;;sprint` to populate the sprint page with a template"
            - "Use {{Sync with Backlog}} to synchronize stories between the [[Backlog]] and the Sprint Plan. This will synchronize stories nested under the sprint on the [[Backlog]]."
            - Other automation on the Sprint template:
                - "Use {{Count Story Points}} to check volume of work planned for sprint. "
                - "Use {{Start Sprint}} to change sprint status to active, and insert first data point on the Burn Down chart."
        - "Backlog Grooming"
            - "Rank stories on the [[Backlog]] using standard Roam features"
            - "{{Find stories missing from the Backlog}} to pull in pages in the **story/** namespace, but not yet present on the [[Backlog]]. Imagine the scenario when you think of another story while reviewing customer feedback, working on a user story, etc. This button helps to tie these loose ends. "
                - ""üìù**Note:** the button in the how-to is a dummy button""
                - "When you cancel a story, either delete the **story/** page from the database or if for some reason you want to keep it, move the canceled story under __Canceled Items__ at the bottom of the Backlog. This is required, else if you didn't delete the page but deleted the story from the backlog, the next time you press "Find stories..." the story would be added to the list again. By storing these stories hidden away under Canceled Items, the "Find stories..." program will see the story is referenced on the [[Backlog]] and won't add it again."
            - """Use `;;User Story` to populate the story page with a template"""
        - "Sprint Demo & Sprint Retrospective"
            - "Use Sprint Demo on the Sprint Page to outline your Sprint Demo presentation. Include video, screenshots, etc."
            - "Use Retrospective on the Sprint Page to track team feedback about [[(i) Team Ways of Working]]"
            - "{{Close Sprint}} to set sprint status to closed, to set completed stories to closed, and to tick off stories and the sprint on the [[Backlog]]"
                - ""üìù**Note:** the button in the how-to is a dummy button""
- ## ^^Getting started with using the template^^
    - **Video:** Getting sstarted with the Roam Agile Template
        - {{[[video]]: https://youtu.be/L8RYtTzAAYU}}
    - Open [[roam/js]] and start scripts (you only need to do this once)
        - Optional [[roam/js/tag-cycle]] configure hot-keys for tag cycle
    - Open [[roamAgile/team]] and set up your team. You need to edit this every time there are changes on the team
        - The names listed on this page are used for generating Daily Standup `jjStandup` prompts, and for selecting owners on [[Customer Feedback]].
        - List team members in separate blocks, using page links (else owners on [[Customer Feedback]] won't be links)
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamAgile%2FGi5Qq219EW.png?alt=media&token=cd2ef588-f5e4-4d56-9410-1dfa61b84611)
    - Edit the [[(i) Team Ways of Working]] page with agreed modus operandi for the team.
    - Create your [[Product Vision]]
    - Develop your [[Personas]]
        - "You may try De Bono's [[AoT/OPV: Other People's Views]] to identify stakholders. `jjOPV`"
        - "Create a page for each [[Persona]] under the **persona/** namespace and using the `;;persona` template"
    - Add stories to the [[Backlog]]
        - Stories should be in the **story/** namespace.
        - Rank stories and tentatively organize stories into sprints by nesting stories under links to sprints. Sprints should be in the **sprint/** namespace.
        - Optionally organize sprints into epics.
        - Add `{{[[TODO]]}}` checkboxes to your stories, sprints and epics on the backlog. This will help you filter on completed stories later.
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamAgile%2F8hUSnIehAX.png?alt=media&token=d0d92116-980f-4fa8-90ea-ffcb30356b94)

    - Develop your user stories in Backlog Grooming sessions with your Product Owner and Developer Team
        - Open story pages from the [[Backlog]]
        - Use `;;User Story` to populate the story page with a template
            - You may freely change the template except for the 3 attributes at the top.
                - Valid values for **Status** are: #status/draft #status/active #status/closed #status/canceled
                - Valid values for **Estimate** are numbers. The best practice is to use numbers from the [fibonacci sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html#:~:text=It%20is%20that%20simple!,out%20the%20next%20few%20numbers%3F) as story points. This is not about precision, no need to estimate e.g. 1.5 story points. Make it 2.
                - Valid values for **Assigned to** are names from the [[roamAgile/team]] page.
        - Use [Algorithms of Thought]([[roamAgile/AoT]]) to help you with thinking
        - Use `{{mermaid}}` to add diagrams. Read more about Mermaid [here](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).
            - You may also find the [Mermaid live editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/) helpful.
    - Plan your sprint
        - Open the [[Backlog]]
        - Shift click each story on the [[Backlog]] for the next sprint to validate readiness of the story.
            - Read the story
            - Check estimate
            - Assign owner
        - Once you are comfortable with the user stories, right click the the [[Backlog]] and select "Open in Sidebar"
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamAgile%2FfqzsEHXDqP.png?alt=media&token=dc890f7b-ed29-4043-8a5e-ddff337f307f)
        - Open the sprint from the [[Backlog]]
        - Use `;;sprint` to populate the sprint page with a template
            - Note the columns in the Sprint Plan kanban board may be changed, except for the first "To Do" and last "Done"
            - The Burn Down chart only supports two lines ("To Do" and "Done"). "To Do" is an aggregate of all Sprint Plan kanban columns before "Done". i.e. a story in "Doing" will show up on the Burn Down aggregated under "To Do" i.e. as not yet delivered.
        - Use {{Sync with Backlog}} to synchronize stories between the [[Backlog]] and the Sprint Plan. This will synchronize stories nested under the sprint on the [[Backlog]].
            - üìù**Note:** the button in the how-to is a dummy button
            - üìù**Note:** Sync with Backlog will not syncronize empty stories, i.e. pages in the **story/** namespace that haven't been populated with the `;;User Story` template
            - You'll be ablt to better manage this process by having the Sprint Plan and the Backlog open side by side
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamAgile%2FUwJ0CGEcH6.png?alt=media&token=daa1dca6-6e32-42e0-8973-e71da72e9c74)
        - Use {{Count Story Points}} to check volume of work planned for sprint. 
            - "üìù**Note:** the button in the how-to is a dummy button"
        - Use {{Start Sprint}} to change sprint status to active, and insert first data point on the Burn Down chart.
            - "üìù**Note:** the button in the how-to is a dummy button"
    - Detailed action plan for developing the story, and also test scenarios and test results in the `;;User Story` template.
    - Daily standup (aka. Daily Scrum) meeting
        - Use `jjStandup` on the Daily Notes Page to populate the page with the Daily Standup questions. 
        - üìù**Note:** The kanban board on the Daily Standup page is not automatically synchronized with the active sprint. The kanban board for each person on the Daily Notes page is only intended as a snapshot in time to reflect status of development work.
        - The Stanup template depends on the [[roamAgile/team]] page to list members of the team.
        - For the daily standup meeting I recommend openning the Daily Notes page in the main pane, and the sprint plan in the sidebar. As progress is discussed, the Scrum Master may move items between the column of the kanban board on the Sprint Plan page.
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamAgile%2F07SucTGsCs.png?alt=media&token=93cc1e95-5634-447b-b9ee-c7d79c9b652d)
    - Backlog Grooming
        - Rank stories on the [[Backlog]] using standard Roam features
        - {{Find stories missing from the Backlog}} to pull in pages in the **story/** namespace, but not yet present on the [[Backlog]]. Imagine the scenario when you think of another story while reviewing customer feedback, working on a user story, etc. This button helps to tie these loose ends. 
            - "üìù**Note:** the button in the how-to is a dummy button"
            - When you cancel a story, either delete the **story/** page from the database or if for some reason you want to keep it, move the canceled story under __Canceled Items__ at the bottom of the Backlog. This is required, else if you didn't delete the page but deleted the story from the backlog, the next time you press "Find stories..." the story would be added to the list again. By storing these stories hidden away under Canceled Items, the "Find stories..." program will see the story is referenced on the [[Backlog]] and won't add it again.
        - ""Use `;;User Story` to populate the story page with a template""
    - Sprint Demo & Sprint Retrospective
        - Use Sprint Demo on the Sprint Page to outline your Sprint Demo presentation. Include video, screenshots, etc.
        - During the sprint demo, open the Sprint Plan in the main pane, and the User Story being presented in the sidebar. Having the user story open, will remind the team of the acceptance criteria for each story.
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FRoamAgile%2FQ8aGQFHAu4.png?alt=media&token=c90e35e9-ba6d-4733-b9d6-387e01ef9527)
        - Use Retrospective on the Sprint Page to track team feedback about [[(i) Team Ways of Working]]
            - If the team wants to keep some of the comments at the retrospective meeting private, they may use the `{{[[encrypt]]}}` block functionality in Roam
        - {{Close Sprint}} to set sprint status to closed, to set completed stories to closed, and to tick off stories and the sprint on the [[Backlog]]
            - "üìù**Note:** the button in the how-to is a dummy button"
    - Capture [[Customer Feedback]]
        - "Use {{Add Customer Feedback}} on [[Customer Feedback]] to add feedback to your database."
            - "The SmartButton will ask for the feedback, past it from the clipboard."
            - "It will then run Sentiment Analysis, ask for feedback type and offer the opportunity to assign an owner. Owners are offered from the [[roamAgile/team]] page."

- ## Extension guide
    - **Video:** What's Under the Hood?
        - {{[[video]]: https://youtu.be/FLqeknEOczw}}
    - Check `window.roamAgile` struct ([[roam/js]] [[(i) RoamAgile]]) to see soft coded elements of the model. Change parameters here should you want to alter some of the naming conventions in the template
        - Team must be listed on [[roamAgile/team]]
        - Stories are expected in the **story/** namespace
        - Sprints are expected in the **sprint/** namespace
        - Backlog is on the [[Backlog]] page
        - On the `;;Sprint` template
            - Sprint Plan section (above the sprint kanban) must start with **Sprint Plan**
            - Burndown chart section (above the `{{line}}` chart) must start with **Burn Down**
        - Attributes on the Sprint Page and Story Page are
            - **Estimate:**
            - **Assigned to:**
            - **Status:**
        - Status codes are soft coded:
            - **status/active**, **status/draft**, **status/closed**
            - note if you change statuses, make sure it remains a single word. i.e. "state/open" would be ok, but "state/in dev" would not. You need to make some more invasive changes to the code to accommodate for multi word statuses.
    - Hard coded logic
        - stories are expected to be nested under the sprint on the backlog.
    - Other aspects of the model may be freely changed without impact to application logic
    - Naming conventions used
        - Entities are stored in their respective namespaces. Namespaces start with lower case letter and are nouns in singular form.
            - Stories in **story/**
            - Sprints in **sprint/**
            - Personas in **persona/**
            - Epics in **epic/**
            - Template: **template/**
        - #status/draft, #status/active, #status/closed
        - #priority/low, #priority/medium, #priority/high
        - sentiment/Neutral: #sentiment/Neutral 
sentiment/Negative: #sentiment/Negative
sentiment/VeryNegative: #sentiment/VeryNegative
sentiment/Positive: #sentiment/Positive
sentiment/VeryPositive: #sentiment/VeryPositive

        - feedbacktype/Feature: #feedbacktype/Feature
feedbacktype/Comment: #feedbacktype/Comment
feedbacktype/Question: #feedbacktype/Question
    - Further development opportunities
        - There are many, here are couple of ideas
            - By adding a tag to learnings captured during the retrospective meeting, you could add a random reminder to the daily standup page. This would serve as a practical tool to remind the development team of past agreements.
            - Design templates for Epics and Features.
            - Integrate [Mercury - Tweet This](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mercury/fjclkljmpggljoimiocgcjhjgkcbknfm) into graph to facilitate sharing sprint results with user community.
