    - PMI is a perception-broadening attention-directing algorithm. It 
forces the thinker to explore a situation before coming to a judgement. 
It is pronounced 'P', 'M', 'I'.
    - PMI looks at a case and assesses the plus points, the minus points 
and the interesting points. It is a scanning algorithm. This means it is
 not a matter of thinking of points as they come up and then dropping 
each into a box labelled PLUS, MINUS, or INTERESTING, but first looking in the PLUS direction and noting what you see (ignoring any other points), and then repeating the same for MINUS and INTERESTING as well. You should keep the sequence of plus, minus and interesting.
    - **Example**
        - #PMI
            - ### **Case:** The last person to stand in line is the first to get on the ride in Amusement Parks
            - **Plus:**
                - No long lines as it is not a good strategy to stand in line, if the last to arrive gets in first
                - People move around more, entrances to rides are less crowed
                - When you arrive at just the right moment, you can get on a ride quickly
            - **Minus:**
                - Unpredictable. If you are unlucky, you may not get on a ride the whole day
                - Fights may evolve as people are trying to get to the back of the line
            - **Interesting:**
                - People that like to mix and mingle might find this a great 
opportunity to connect with more people then just standing in line in 
the traditional way
                - Maybe an inverse line would eventually emerge
