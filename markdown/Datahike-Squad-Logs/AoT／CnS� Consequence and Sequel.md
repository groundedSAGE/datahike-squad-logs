    - The tool is pronounced 'C and S'. If your thinking is going to result in action of any sort, then you have to understand the consequences of that action. Will it work? What are the benefits? What are the problems and dangers (i.e. risks)? What are the costs? How certain are you in your predictions?

CnS is an exploration into the future and evaluation of likely outcomes. There is a relationship between CnS, CAF and OPV. What happens in the future may be considered a factor (CAF) and it will affect other people (OPV).

The time scale of CnS can be immediate, short-term, medium-term and long-term. Treat the definition of time scales flexibly depending on the situation you are facing. In some cases immediate could mean literally the next minute, in others the next year.

Risks address questions such as: What might go wrong and what is the worst thing that could go wrong? What are the dangers? What is the best possible outcome and what is the most likely outcome?

Finally certainty deals with the level of certainty or uncertainty regarding outcomes. The scale runs from being absolutely sure about the outcome to having no idea what will happen.
