    - **Where to write?**
        - The primary place to write in [[Datahike-Squad-Logs]] is on the daily notes page. Nest everything under a [[My Daily Notes]] block with your name. If it is a [[Squad Logs]] the same concepts apply. It is best to capture notes nested under your name.
        - Everything starts at the daily notes page. After that references can be made to what is has been captured in the daily notes page and elaborated on elsewhere. For example: capturing a `TODO` or adding some insight in [[My Daily Notes]] and then referencing that inside of stories **tasks** or **comments**
    - If you make changes anywhere in the database OUTSIDE of writing within your [Daily Notes](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Roam-Collective/page/Pti1cH_0g) section, make a note in your [[Change Log]]

- ## Collaboration Conventions
    - Tagging others within the graph.
        -  `[[Their Name]]` - passive mention. Not directed at them in any way.
        -  `[[@[[Their Name]]]]` - active mention. Tagged with action/reply requested.
        -  `[[cc:[[Their Name]]]]` - passive copy. No action requested. Simply copying them on something.
    - Managing mentions:
        - Change `@` or `cc:` to:
            -  `~` to mark as seen.
            -  `^` to mark as saved.
        - You may also choose to bookmark a mention by referencing the block into your DNP section with a tag.
    - Using the #Conversation module
    - Using the #Chat (top-level section)
        - A Chat tag is usually pinned to the top of each day's [[DNP]].
        - To promote something for discussion, make a post in the #Chat section, with reference to the content you want discussed. You can tag specific people, or leave it blank.
        - You can also use the #Conversation [module](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Roam-Collective/page/_ala-JkX-) within your [[DNP Section]] to start a chat with a specific person if you don't want it elevated to the main feed.
        - As a graph member, keep an eye on your mentions and the Chat sections for opportunities to offer your input.
- ## Additional Conventions
    - **Commenting on graph contents**
Comment on the contents of the graph by block referencing and nesting comments underneath within your `#Conversation` section
        - Example::
            - For now please defer to this [example](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Roam-Collective/page/RZi4J5Dkm) from [[Roam Collective]] 
    - **Adding new collections** (When starting, I'd rather you suggest them first)
When you add a new "collection", please add it to the change log with a description.
        - Example::
            - Added #[[Chat]]
- ## Tips:
    - Added by [[Wade Dominic]] - [copied from](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Roam-Collective/page/KzdkcgPM2)
        - **Learn through observation.** Watch how others document their information to learn together. I'll take the lead on most conventions so that we can establish some homogeneity in style â€” but if you have ideas for some new conventions, tag them as `# [[[[Feedback]]: [[Suggestions]]]]` and  (I'll review these periodically)
        - Keep an eye on the `[[Change Log]]` ... this is a great place to see changes to the graph's conventions and processes over time.
